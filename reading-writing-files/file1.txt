NewFile returns a new File with the given file descriptor and name. 
The returned value will be nil if fd is not a valid file descriptor. 
On Unix systems, if the file descriptor is in non-blocking mode, 
NewFile will attempt to return a pollable File (one for which the 
SetDeadline methods work).
After passing it to NewFile, fd may become invalid under the same 
conditions described in the comments of the Fd method, and the same 
constraints apply.
